    <h3> Description </h3>
    <p>
      This is an Italian-style pasta sauce with homemade meatballs that's
      cooked slowly over low heat for an intense tomato flavor. It's easy to
      make the spaghetti sauce ahead of time; gently reheat and add meatballs
      30 minutes before you're ready to serve with your favorite pasta.
